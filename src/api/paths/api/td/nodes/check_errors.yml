  summary: Check errors in the specified node and its children
  description: |
    Check for errors in the node at the specified path and recursively check all child nodes.
    This is equivalent to calling `op('nodePath').errors(recurse=True)` in TouchDesigner's Python API.
    Returns a list of all error messages from the node and its children, or an empty list if no errors exist.

    **Important Note:** Due to TouchDesigner's limitations, when checking container nodes (baseCOMP, containerCOMP, etc.)
    that can contain children, errors in dynamically created child nodes may not be detected until the container is cooked
    or opened. If you suspect errors are not being reported, try calling `cook()` on the container or opening it in the
    TouchDesigner UI before running this tool.
